            Collaborating cross-functionally, I transformed core frameworks with
            proficiency in React and TypeScript, ensuring consistent design
            across platforms, adapting to emerging technologies, and emphasizing
            comprehensive browser testing. I integrated front-end components,
            contributed to database design, and implemented responsive design
            principles to optimize website speed, participating in code reviews
            for quality assurance and stability.
